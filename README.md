# PixaBay Image Search - Take Home Assesment

## Assignment

This is a take-home technical challenge meant to both test your technical abilities with React as well as your prioritization of features given a fixed time frame. Using [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) as a datasource, you will create a web app with a screen for searching for images as well as another screen for viewing individual image details. You will need an API url and API key from Pixabay which you can get by following the above link.

The image search screen should include a search bar and list of images that can be clicked. Upon clicking on an image, you should be navigated to the image detail screen. The image detail screen should display the user that posted the image as well as any relevant tags.

You will have 3 hours to complete this challenge, and we ask that you complete it all in one sitting, using commits to mark when you started and finished, even if you go over on time. Upon completion, push your code to Github (to your own account) as you will be presenting the code to Matthew at a later time.

## Description

After following the instructions below to run the application, you can search for an image using the search bar. You can also toggle the number of images shown on the page by select 10, 25, or 50 images per page. The images presented in the grid contain the author and the relevant tags for the image. By clicking on a particular image you can view an image detail screen which displays a larger resolution of the image, the user that posted the image, and the corresponding tags for the specified image. In addition, the detail view of the image provides a link for the author's PixaBay page where one can view additional images submitted by the author.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
